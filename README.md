# Reinforcement learning

This project implements Deep Q-Learning agents using PyTorch to solve various reinforcement learning environments from the OpenAI Gym.

Successfully Solved Environments:
* CartPole-v1
* More coming soon...

## Usage

For the first time:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Then always:
```
conda activate reinforcement-learning
python -m environments.cartpole
```
Replace *cartpole* with the name of the environment that you want.
